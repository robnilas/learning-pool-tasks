## Introduction

The Learning Pool LMS Learning Management System (LPLMS) is a platform that allows companies and organisations to manage learning content for their staff, and to report on delivery of statutory and mandatory learning. The platform is written in PHP and founded upon the Moodle Open Source LMS.

This assignment requires you reproduce the graphical mock-up supplied in the accompanying zip file (reference-design.png) as a single, static web page using CSS(3). Bootstrap 3.3.7 is included which you should use.

It is expected that the task should take no longer than 3-4 hours to complete. You should be prepared to talk through your solution in the interview.

## Task Specification

This task requires you to:

- Edit the index.html and task.css files to match the graphical mockup
- Add classes to the HTML elements but avoid changing the structure where possible
- Ensure that the solution looks and functions correctly in IE11 and the latest Chrome and Edge browsers

Some considerations:

- Use of LESS or SASS is optional. If you do, please include the source files as well as the minified file(s).
- Adding extra functionality or aesthetic flair via JavaScript or jQuery will be welcomed, but not at the expense of polished CSS.
